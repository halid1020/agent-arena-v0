### Vision-based Pick and Place
### Suitable for:
### (1) Action-conditioned Video Prediction
### (2) Behaviour Cloning (Superivsed Learning)
### (3) Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning
### (4) Offline Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Rewards
### (5) Offline Reinforcement Learning with Dense Rewards but only for flattening
### (6) Vision-based Goal-condition Reinforcement Learning

### Cannot do:
### (1) Offline Reinforcement Learning with Dense Rewards for foldings.
