"""The shared console: one browser page, many robots, no hardware imports.

What is served here is everything that is the same whichever robot is plugged
in -- the collection drive and which directory is open, the episode browser's
lifecycle operations, the experiment grouping, and the training tab. Each of
those reasons about files and remote machines, never about a device.

Anything that DOES touch a device is reached through the selected rig's agent, a
subprocess started with that rig's own interpreter (see
``actoris_harena.rigs``). The console never imports feetech, ur-rtde, mujoco or
pyrealsense2, and could not: this rig's venv and the next one's cannot both
exist in one environment.

The rig is chosen in the page. ``/api/console`` says which rigs are known and
which is selected; ``/api/console/rig`` selects one.

Not served here, and deliberately: the episode browser's playback routes and the
Collect and Signals tabs. Those still live in each rig repo's own
``tool/rig_web.py`` -- they reach into that repo's motion model, its sensor view
and its teleop entry point, and they move behind the agent next. A rig repo's
console and this one are the same routes either way; only the composition root
differs.
