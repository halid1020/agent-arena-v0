# actoris_harena -- task runner for the shared rig pipeline.
#
# The simulated arenas are NOT covered here: their tests are imperative
# __main__ scripts under test/, run individually, and they need the [sim]
# extra's dependency stack. These targets cover the rig pipeline, which is what
# the robot repos import.
#
# THIS PACKAGE HAS NO VENV OF ITS OWN, and that is the whole design: it is
# installed into each robot repo's environment, because a rig's venv is what
# pins its LeRobot checkout and its hardware libraries. So these targets need an
# interpreter that has `actoris_harena[rig]` installed, and the sensible one is
# a rig's:
#
#     make test-unit PY=../so101_garment/venv/bin/python
#
# With no PY given they look for a sibling rig's venv and use the first that can
# import the package. If none can, they say so rather than failing with
# thirty-odd ModuleNotFoundErrors about numpy.

# Candidate interpreters, in order: whatever PY says, then any sibling repo's
# venv. `wildcard` expands only to paths that exist, so a machine with one rig
# checked out tries exactly one.
CANDIDATES := $(PY) $(wildcard ../*/venv/bin/python)
# The first candidate that can import the package AND its dependencies.
#
# Testing `import actoris_harena` alone proves nothing, which cost a confusing
# ten minutes: the package __init__ is lazy by design and imports only os and
# pathlib, so it succeeds under any interpreter run from this directory -- the
# directory itself is importable. The deps are what actually distinguish an
# environment that can run the tests from one that cannot.
_PROBE := import numpy, aiohttp, cv2, yaml, actoris_harena
PYTHON := $(firstword $(foreach p,$(CANDIDATES),\
    $(shell $(p) -c "$(_PROBE)" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo $(p))))
